summary: 'My reflections on what a good engineering manager should look like'
---
I haven't posted anything in the past two months. A lot of things have happened, in both work and personal life.
Maybe I will write about personal life one day, and this blog will be about work only.

A lot of people have left my company recently. Their reasons of leaving the company also triggered me to reflect on my experience being managed by my managers since I've started working, and managing my own team since April last year.

Here are a few qualities that the current me thinks a good manager should have. I'm sure some of the ideas will change later, but here's what I think right now.

# No micromanagement
My definition of micromanagement is to tell someone who knows what to do what to do.
There is definitely some psychological effect on micromanagement - it's the feeling that you are about to do something willingly, only to find the enthusiasm wane the moment your manager mandates it.


I think a lot of micromanagement comes from the insecurity of managers. It can come in two ways. Firstly, it can arise from a lack of trust in their team. They treat their team members as incompetent, so they have to be involved in every detail and tell them what to do.
Secondly, it could be a reflection of their own insecurities, particularly when they lack a comprehensive understanding of your tasks and can't alter broader strategies, they can only focus on the small details that are easy to grasp on and give you command on these small things.


As a manager, realizing that you might have the habit of micromanaging is already a good start. Trust me a lot of managers never do.

Balancing between giving enough guidance and being micromanaging is definitely difficult. One framework I really like is the [situational leadership theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Situational_leadership_theory). It categorizes the team members into 4 stages, and you need to give a different amount of support and encouragement based on what stage they're in.
To a new grad, you should definitely give them more attention and support. However, to a senior TL, you should give them more encouragement and motivation, instead of detailed guidance.
