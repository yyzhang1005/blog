I want to kick off my very first blog post with something that's totally taking over my life right now - the ACL reconstruction surgery. I had the ACL Reconstruction surgery (no meniscus repair) with quadriceps tendon autograft on July 19th 2023, and following is my journey.

<TOCInline toc={props.toc} exclude="Introduction" />

## ‚ùì What happened?
My MRI from April 2023 said my ACL was chronically torn, and that diagnose turned out to be quite accurate.

I didn't just mess up my knee once. Nope, I did it a grand total of four times, all thanks to my blissful ignorance.

- The first time was from bouldering in October 2022. I‚Äôm a beginner rock climber. Honestly, I can't remember all the details, but I know I crashed down on my right leg after a failed dyno attempt. After that I immediately felt some pain from my right knee, and it started giving out even when I was just walking on the pad. The next day I went to see a doctor and they told me it‚Äôs just a MCL sprain so naturally I shrugged it off.
- A week later I went to New York and went to see the immersive show Sleep no more. There was a lot of day activity walking around the city so my legs were already quite tired by the 9pm showtime. During the show, the audiences need to run around in the 5-floor ‚Äúhotel‚Äù to follow the actors. Then, a witch character picked me for an 1:1 experience. She brought me to a dark room, said some random things and started to shake my body, and.. my knee gave out. I had to take a breather and uber back home.
- Fast forward to early December, with the snow season in full swing, I couldn't resist the call of Tahoe's slopes. The second when I strapped in my right leg (i‚Äôm goofy) I knew my leg was not ready for this. However I still wanted to give it a try, and we went on some blue mogul runs. On some moguls when I was sliding down I felt my knee buckled. I still snowboarded down but I decided to call it a day, and rested in the cabin for the second day as well.
- Fast forward another month, and I'm back on the snowboard in mid-January. This time, I was sticking to the gentler blue and green runs, avoiding any moguls or bumps. All was going well until early February. A massive snowstorm lured me to heavenly slopes with some friends. My knee played nice for most of the day, but during the very last run, it popped again. I had to lay low for a few minutes and eventually slid down the mountain.

All in all, I think the biggest mistake I have made is to ignore the possibility that it could be a severe injury. Glad that at least I finally got an MRI in April and found out the issue.

## üßë‚Äç Surgery D-Day
My surgery was schedule at 12:00PM. I arrived around 11:00PM, did a bunch of paperwork, and was pushed to the surgery room around 13:00PM. I got the general anesthesia and woke up around 5:30PM. The nurse told me that the surgeon only fixed the ACL and no meniscus repair (thank god). My friend picked me back home. Luckily I didn‚Äôt feel any nausea from the general anesthesia (just a bit of sore throat), so I had a good dinner after a day of fasting. I also had the nerve block so I actually didn‚Äôt feel much pain right after the surgery.

## ‚åöÔ∏è My recovery timeline
I had ACL reconstruction with my own quad tendon. I realized the recovery process is super unique to each individual and their surgeon‚Äôs preferences. What I'm sharing here is my own personal experience, so take it with a grain of salt!

- Day 0 (7/19): 13:00PM surgery
- Day 2 (7/21): around midnight the nerve block starts to wear off, got pretty much no sleep.
- Day 3 (7/22): Pain took a back seat; was able to use restroom on my own for the first time
- Day 4 (7/23): pain eased up even more, was able to switch off norco and transitioned to ibuprofen; pooped first time after the surgery; can do some leg raises
- Day 5 (7/24): first post op, removed dressing; started PT following doctor‚Äôs instruction; can unlock brace during the day; flexion at 30
- Day 9 (7/28): official PT started, flexion at 90, noticed yellow bruise on my shin area
- Day 11 (7/31): started feeling electric shocks on my shin
- Day 12 (8/1): 2nd post op, removed stitches and applied steri strips, changed to the hinged knee brace
- Day 14 (8/3): started working from home
- Day 18 (8/7): switched to one crutch
- Day 27 (8/15): got off crutches at home
- Day 33 (8/21): first time driving
- Day 38 (8/26): first time eating outside, working out in the gym, walked 5000 steps

## üéí Post surgery essentials
- support from friends and family
- pain medicine (norco or whatever your doctor prescribes you, ibuprofen)
- Ice machine (you might want to get a smart switch so you can put in the schedule, also instead of buying ice everyday, you can just freeze 4 water bottles and put them in the ice machine)
- a big water bottle
- body wipes
- a wedge pillow
- TV/laptop/books or whatever that can keep you entertained
- a bag or backpack for packing everything to go somewhere else in the house

## üçÉ Wound care && Scar treatment
I got home with a dressing around my knee. They removed the dressing and put on hydrocolloid dressing on the wounds on my 1st post-op visit (6 days after the surgery). Stiches were removed on the 2nd post-op visit (13 days after the surgery) and they put on steri strips on wounds. The steri strips didn't fall off, so I removed them 10 days later.

In terms of the scar treatment, since I've just started, so I'm not sure whether it's going to be effective or not. From my quick online digging, there are two substance that can potentially be helpful 1) silicone gel 2)onion extract, but silicone gel is proved to be more effective. And for the wound to heal better, you basically need to 1) keep them moisturized 2) keep them away from the sun. So I've decided to use the kelo-cote silicone gel at night and the silicone gel sheet during the day (so hopefully it can serve as a modicum of sun protection).

## üî™ Nerve Damage
A few days after the surgery, I started feeling electric shocks on the left side of my shin. And it has some super weird burning sensations when it touches something. It looks like this is a common side effect of the surgery that's called saphenous neuritis. As of right now, four weeks since the surgery, there has been some improvement in these symptoms; however, they have not entirely subsided.

## üèãÔ∏è Physical therapy
I started doing PT at home since day 4 after the surgery. And I'm doing PT everyday now at home, and goes to the facility twice a week. This is definitely one of the most important parts of the healing process. Depends on the surgery you get and your own fitness level, the process is highly personalized.

## üíï Thanks
I should put this part at the top (but don't want to be too cheesy LOL) because I think without my friends' support I didn't even have the courage to get the surgery. I was so lucky to have a friend that let me stay with her and take care of me after the surgery, and have so many friends that come visit, bring me food, take me outside, keep me company.

Y asked me if I had more physical pain or more mental pain cause by the surgery. Looking back, the month leading up to the surgery, I was mentally stressed about the procedure and what comes after. But once I was on the other side, there was only physical pain - mentally I was happy most of the days because I'm surrounded by my friends.

Trust the process.
