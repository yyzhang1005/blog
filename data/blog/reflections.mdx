## Enjoy being a Sisyphus
"The Myth of Sisyphus" is an essay written by Albert Camus. In the myth, Sisyphus is condemned by the gods to roll a boulder up a hill for all eternity, only to have it roll back down each time he reaches the top.
Albert Camus uses Sisyphus' futile and repetitive task as a representation of the human condition – our struggles, efforts, and endeavors that might seem meaningless in the grand scheme of things.

That's exactly how I feel about my daily life - what is the meaning of my time spent on family, friends, work, hobbies?
Does it make a dent in the universe, even a tiny one?

Probably not.

So what should I live for?  As of now, my answer is: it's about cherishing the small moments. It might be the moment when you flex the muscles you gain from rolling up the boulder to the girl you like;
It might be the moment when you see the sunset on your 1989th time going uphill; It might be the fruits you randomly find on your way back down to the bottom.

We are here already, and we don't have a choice. So just enjoy being the Sisyphus.

Approach things sincerely, not seriously.

## Barbie
I watched the barbie movie last week. Overall, it's an ok movie, but one scene that really stuck in my mind was that when Barbie is in the real world and surprised by the fact that all the construction workers are guys.

For me, a woman in the real world, it has never even crossed my mind that construction workers can be all women!

The tech industry is certainly not as male-dominated as construction work, but I also can't recall ever attending a meeting where all the attendees were women. In fact, just last week, I had a meeting with about 15 males, and I was the only female.

I still remember the chat I had with my friend Dragon, a fervent feminist. We were talking about the fact that individuals who are more assertive (and sometimes even aggressive) tend to find greater success in the workplace, often with the aggressive ones being predominantly male.
At the time I was thinking: women can and should adapt and become more assertive.
However, Dragon posed an intriguing question – why should women feel compelled to alter themselves in order to fit into a framework designed around male traits? Why does the very standard itself seem to be constructed based on qualities more commonly associated with men, rather than valuing the diverse strengths of both genders?

Yeah Barbie, the real world is built for men. But hey, there's a glimmer of hope – the Barbie movie is here, and people like me are also tuning into feminists. It's a step forward, don't you think?
