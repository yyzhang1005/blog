I want to kick off my very first blog post with something that's totally taking over my life right now - the ACL reconstruction surgery. I had the ACL Reconstruction surgery (no meniscus repair) with quadriceps tendon autograft on July 19th 2023, and following is my journey.

## What happened?
My MRI from April 2023 said my ACL was chronically torn, and that diagnose turned out to be quite accurate.

I didn't just mess up my knee once. Nope, I did it a grand total of four times, all thanks to my blissful ignorance.

- The first time was from bouldering in October 2022. I’m a beginner rock climber. Honestly, I can't remember all the details, but I know I crashed down on my right leg after a failed dyno attempt. After that I immediately felt some pain from my right knee, and it started giving out even when I was just walking on the pad. The next day I went to see a doctor and they told me it’s just a MCL sprain so naturally I shrugged it off.
- A week later I went to New York and went to see the immersive show Sleep no more. There was a lot of day activity walking around the city so my legs were already quite tired by the 9pm showtime. During the show, the audiences need to run around in the 5-floor “hotel” to follow the actors. Then, a witch character picked me for an 1:1 experience. She brought me to a dark room, said some random things and started to shake my body, and.. my knee gave out. I had to take a breather and uber back home.
- Fast forward to early December, with the snow season in full swing, I couldn't resist the call of Tahoe's slopes. The second when I strapped in my right leg (i’m goofy) I knew my leg was not ready for this. However I still wanted to give it a try, and we went on some blue mogul runs. On some moguls when I was sliding down I felt my knee buckled. I still snowboarded down but I decided to call it a day, and rested in the cabin for the second day as well.
- Fast forward another month, and I'm back on the snowboard in mid-January. This time, I was sticking to the gentler blue and green runs, avoiding any moguls or bumps. All was going well until early February. A massive snowstorm lured me to heavenly slopes with some friends. My knee played nice for most of the day, but during the very last run, it popped again. I had to lay low for a few minutes and eventually slid down the mountain.

All in all, I think the biggest mistake I have made is to ignore the possibility that it could be a severe injury. Glad that at least I finally got an MRI in April and found out the issue.

## Surgery D-Day
My surgery was schedule at 12:00PM. I arrived around 11:00PM, did a bunch of paperwork, and was pushed to the surgery room around 13:00PM. I got the general anesthesia and woke up around 5:30PM. The nurse told me that the surgeon only fixed the ACL and no meniscus repair (thank god). My friend picked me back home. Luckily I didn’t feel any nausea from the general anesthesia (just a bit of sore throat), so I had a good dinner after a day of fasting. I also had the nerve block so I actually didn’t feel much pain right after the surgery.

## My recovery timeline
I had ACL reconstruction with my own quad tendon. I realized the recovery process is super unique to each individual and their surgeon’s preferences. What I'm sharing here is my own personal experience, so take it with a grain of salt!

- Day 0 (7/19): 13:00PM surgery
- Day 2 (7/21): around midnight the nerve block starts to wear off, got pretty much no sleep.
- Day 3 (7/22): Pain took a back seat; was able to use restroom on my own for the first time
- Day 4 (7/23): pain eased up even more, was able to switch off norco and transitioned to ibuprofen; pooped first time after the surgery; can do some leg raises
- Day 5 (7/24): first post op, removed dressing; started PT following doctor’s instruction; can unlock brace during the day; flexion at 30
- Day 9 (7/28): official PT started, flexion at 90, noticed yellow bruise on my shin area
- Day 11 (7/31): started feeling electric shocks on my shin
- Day 12 (8/1): 2nd post op, removed stitches and applied steri strips, changed to the hinged knee brace
- Day 14 (8/3): started working from home
- Day 18 (8/7): switched to one crutch

## Post surgery essentials
- support from friends and family
- pain medicine (norco or whatever your doctor prescribes you, ibuprofen)
- Ice machine (switch, water bottle)
- a big water bottle
- body wipes
- a wedge pillow
- TV/laptop/books or whatever that can keep you entertained
- a bag or backpack for packing everything to go somewhere else in the house
