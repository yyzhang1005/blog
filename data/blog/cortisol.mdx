summary: 'My learnings about Cortisol'
---
I'm always fascinated by hormones. They are so tiny, but they have a huge impact on our bodies. I'm going to start with cortisol - the hormone that I'm trying my best to regulate at the moment.

I want to emphasize that I am not an expert at all. I acquire all of my knowledge from online sources such as podcasts, websites, and blogs (with huge help from LLMs LOL, i.e. perplexity.ai). Therefore, there is a high possibility that my interpretations are hallucinations :)

## What does cortisol do
Cortisol is a steroid hormone that plays many important roles in the body. It is often referred to as the body's main stress hormone because it is released in response to stress and helps the body respond to it.

It regulates metabolism, suppresses inflammation, regulates blood pressure, blood sugar, boosts energy.

However, chronic or prolonged exposure to high levels of cortisol due to chronic stress can have negative effects on health. It can contribute to conditions such as high blood pressure, diabetes, obesity, and weakened immune function.High cortisol levels will also lower the estrogen and testosterone levels.


## Ideal cortisol level throughout the day
The ideal cortisol level throughout the day follows a pattern called "diurnal variation." Cortisol levels are highest in the morning upon waking and gradually decline throughout the day, reaching their lowest point at night.
Maintaining a good cortisol release cycle is very important - disruptions in cortisol levels, including elevated levels at night, can contribute to mood disorders.

## How to maintain a healthy cortisol release cycle
Here comes the famous Huberman's morning routine:
- Within 30 mins after waking, get out and get some sunlight - this will improve your focus, energy levels, learning throughout the day, and prevent a late shift in cortisol increase. On a sunny day, 10 mins is enough. On a cloudy day you might want to get 30 mins of sunglight.
- Drink coffee 2 hours after waking -  cortisol levels are naturally high in the morning, and drinking coffee immediately after waking up can disrupt the natural cortisol rhythm, potentially leading to poor sleep quality and difficulty waking up in the morning. Waiting two hours before consuming caffeine helps preserve the natural cortisol pattern, promoting better sleep and wakefulness.

## Ashwagandha
Ashwagandha is an adaptogenic herb that has been shown to help reduce cortisol levels and support a healthy stress response. It actually works for me - I want to go to sleep immediately everytime I take it at night. In fact I just did, so I'm going to sleep now, and this is the end of this blog.
